# Conferences

This repo is where I note down everything I have on conferences and all my CFPs!
If you want to look at my talk videos and resources for my talks in meetups, 
conferences or anything, checkout https://github.com/karuppiah7890/talks

This list is highly for me and my career. So, it's based on my
interests and the fields that I work in and the technologies that I use.

I have kept it open so that if someone is like me - working in the same
field as me and with technologies that I work on, then they can benefit
from this information ðŸ˜„

This is more like my journey - on how I'm going about checking out
conferences, which ones I check. Which ones I apply to. What I write
in my CFP while applying. May be I'll even think on my why for speaking
and write that down too. I guess it will vary over time. git history
should help with seeing how it changes ðŸ˜‰
